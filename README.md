# RobotCraft 2019
This repository includes all code developed during the RobotCraft 2019 course. RobotCraft is something in-between a summer camp and a collective internship promoted by Ingeniarius; a company devoted to the development of robotic solutions and other hi-tech devices, and University of Coimbra, through their Robotics Club and the Institute of Systems and Robotics. RobotCraft 2016, 2017 and 2018 received an overall number of 237 participants coming from more than 100 universities spread across more than 20 different countries.

RobotCraft is way more than the typical classroom learning or even laboratory work. The programme provides a general overview of the science and art behind robotics, teaching the basis around mechatronics, Arduino low-level programming, Robot Operating System (ROS) high-level design, and artificial intelligence, thus being divided into multiple modules, designated as crafts, carefully prepared to provide a wide range of skills and knowledge in the topic. This 4th edition has been facelifted when compared to the previous versions, with an increased focus in ROS, tackling the current academic and non-academic needs within the world of robotics.

### Specific Objectives
* To promote concepts and theorems for the introduction to robotics, describing the history of
robotics and its evolution;
* To acquire basic electromechanical concepts, applied in the development of robotic platforms;
* To understand the potential use of Atmel microcontrollers, using the Arduino platform;
* To understand the potential use of the ROS framework;
* To acquire C/C++ programming skills;
* To understand the use of sensors (e.g., range finders, encoders, cameras) and actuators (e.g.,
servo motors, stepper motors, DC motors) used in robotics;
* To explore and apply the concepts of networks and different communications architectures to
robotics;
* To explore and apply concepts of artificial intelligence in robotics;
* To consolidate concepts learned during the modules for the full design of a mobile robotic
platform, including electromechanical assembly, low-level and high-level programming, and
artificial intelligence;
* To validate the design of the mobile robot platform under a competitive scenario.

### The Repository
This repository includes the source code for the exercises and lab tasks as well as some notes from the following crafts:
* Craft 3: Introduction to Programming
* Craft 4: Mechatronics
* Craft 5: Mobile Robotics Programming
